    <p><i>Where Viruses roam below the surface, Vencia is waiting...</i><br>
    <br>
    In this setting, humankind has advanced into the <br>
    future and Earth is on the verge of breaking down from<br>
    overpopulation. After recent discoveries of another<br>
    planet that could be habitable for humankind,<br>
    scientists from all around the world build starships<br>
    to send the younger population off to the planet, Xephia.<br> 
    <br>
    A scientist by the name of Vencia hates the species of<br>
    man, and disgusted by their ways, he created a “virus”<br> 
    that feeds off of humans slowly. After a certain period<br>
    of time, the human will slowly become unresponsive until<br>
    it dies, the virus on the other hand thriving off of the<br>
    nutrients it’s consuming. When the human dies, the virus is<br>
    finally free from having to leech off of a human to be able to<br>
    survive, so now it’s independent. The end goal for viruses was<br>
    to eliminate the chance of humankind surviving and allow viruses<br>
    to thrive, for they’re superior of course. At least to Vencia.<br>
    Vencia, while he grows his ALPHA Viruses, develops a way for himself<br>
    to mutate into a virus so that he can thrive amongst his creations<br>
    on Xephia when he mass massacres the children on board every starship.<br>
